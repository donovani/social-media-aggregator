# Unnamed Social Media Aggregator

### THE PROJECT
A website designed to act as a central hub for all social media platforms using a **simple, unified design**. Written by @donovani and @hallja99 for the everyday person. Tools like this are typically reserved for marketing agencies, but we want to bring that to you.

### SUPPORTED SITES
Our tool aims to cover as many social media platforms as possible. As we complete API support, we'll be looking to map others to our system. **Below is a table of our current plans**:

| Platform  | Status      |
| --------- | ----------: |
| Facebook  | In Progress |
| Twitter   | In Progress |
| Instagram | TBD         |
| Tumblr    | TBD         |
| Reddit    | TBD         |
| LinkedIn  | TBD         |
| Snapchat  | Closed API  |
